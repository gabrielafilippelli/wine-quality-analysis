# Wine Quality Analysis (Red vs White)

## Project Overview
This project explores the physicochemical factors that influence wine quality using red and white vinho verde wine datasets from Portugal. The analysis identifies which attributes are most strongly associated with quality scores and compares differences between wine types.

---

## Analytical Questions
- Which features most influence wine quality?
- Do drivers of quality differ between red and white wines?
- Are there trends or interactions among variables beyond quality?

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.8
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Findings
- Alcohol positively correlates with wine quality.
- Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality, particularly in red wines.
- Differences exist in feature importance between red and white wines.
